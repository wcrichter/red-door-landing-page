            In feng shui, a red door signifies “welcome,” a place where energy enters. The color red means energy and strength, power and passion. It means action and is often a differentiator. When you take that strength and passion, and incorporate it into a strategic-advocacy engagement, you can create action for your organization.  These “red-door” strategies which I share in my new book, Behind the Red Door:  Unlock Your Advocacy Influence and Success, are the tools and tactics needed to help you create effective advocacy efforts.  So enter and see what kind of success awaits you behind the red door of advocacy.

          <h2>Advocacy</h2>
          <h3><i>More Than a Tool on "The Hill"</i></h3>
          <p>
            Advocacy is no longer just a tactic used in political campaigns; we’ve moved beyond “pass a bill; kill a bill.” So what does that mean?
            Today, it is about solving issues and affecting change – inspiring collaboration between nontraditional allies who, even though they may not agree on everything, are coming together to accomplish mutually beneficial goals.  It’s highlighting issues and supporting causes; it’s integrating advocacy tactics with marketing strategies designed to influence decision makers and to change local, state, and federal policy and practice. That’s the differentiator.
